# Lane Detection of a Self Driving Car

In this Project I have designed a program to enhance the video quality during night time by improving Brightness, Saturation and Exposure. In the second part. I have designed the Program sequence to detect the Lanes on a road. Sample video sequence from Udacity's Self Driving Car course was used for detection. The Program also considers Lane changes and provides turn prediction. 

## Import Following Libraries Required to run the program:
1. OpenCV
2. MatplotLib
3. Numpy

## Running the Program
Run the .py files individually through terminal, and ouput video file will be created.

## Outputs
